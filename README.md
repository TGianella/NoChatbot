Nowadays if you need to answer a complex question, you are probably going to spend 5 minutes going back and forth with a LLM chatbot in order to specify your request and get your answer. 

**NoChatbot** tries to go the opposite way:
* Send your complex request once. :man_shrugging:
* The LLM returns a form which you can fill out and send back. :robot:
* This is used to give a final answer to your initial request ! :tada:
